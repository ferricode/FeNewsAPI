## News API with Node.js, Koa and MongoDB


The FeNewsApi is easy-to-use REST API delivering news data in handy JSON format. The API comes with a two news HTTP GET endpoints along with a few parameters you can use to narrow down your news data results. The endpoint `/fenews/filter` allows you to filter the news by date and/or title, while `/fenews/sort` allows you to sort ascending and descending by date and/or title of the news. The news contains information about id, title, short description and link to the full article.  

To get started right away, you don't need an account or API key. Just chose your endpoint and start testing the API.

Your request should start with the character `'?'` and if you use two parameters together you should use betweenn them the character `'&'`.
